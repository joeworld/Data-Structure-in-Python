# Clean example implementations of data structures and algorithms/solutions to common problems ranging from easy to hard

# Contribution!

Contribution is always welcome, though I use Python but language does not matter just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.

Don't remove previous implementations of algorithms. Just add a new file with your own implementation.

Beautify and Clen up your code for easier reading, you can also include your brute force approach and the better approach
